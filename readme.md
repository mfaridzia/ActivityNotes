ActivityNotes App
==================

ActivityNotes is a simple Web-based application using the Laravel framework that is used to record our daily schedule and events, this application is made because I find it very difficult to manage my time well, then from there it comes to mind to create a very simple application that can help me in managing time. This application is still very simple and hopefully this application can be better again.
