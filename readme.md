ActivityNotes App
==================

ActivityNotes is a simple Web-based application using Laravel framework that is used to record the daily schedule of our activities and events, this application I make because I myself feel very difficult to manage my time well, then from there flashed the mind to create a very application simple that can help me in managing the time. This application is still very simple and hopefully this application can be better again.
